  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# 2. THE JOBS: What tasks should be performed?
jobs:
  # Define a job with the ID 'build-and-test'
  build-and-test:
    # 3. THE RUNNER: What kind of machine should this run on?
    # Use the latest version of Ubuntu provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 4. THE STEPS: The sequence of tasks to execute
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      # Step 3: Install project and test dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      # Step 4: Run the tests with pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest

# ... (previous 'build-and-test' job remains the same) ...

  # Define a new job for building and pushing the Docker image
  build-and-push-docker:
    # This job should only run if the 'build-and-test' job succeeds
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
